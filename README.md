📊 Finance Loan Analysis Project

This project analyzes a bank loan dataset to compute important KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and create visual insights.  
It demonstrates data cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and visualization skills using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

---

🔍 Problem Statement

The goal is to analyze loan data and answer key business questions such as:
- How many loan applications were received (overall & month-to-date)?
- How much loan amount was funded and received (overall & month-to-date)?
- What are the average interest rate and average debt-to-income ratio (DTI)?
- What percentage of loans are Good vs Bad?
- How do loan applications vary by state, purpose, employee length, and ownership?

---

✅ KPIs Implemented

- Total Loan Applications (overall & MTD)  
- Total Funded Amount (overall & MTD)  
- Total Amount Received (overall & MTD)  
- Average Interest Rate  
- Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)  
- Good Loan vs Bad Loan metrics:
  - Application Percentage
  - Applications Count
  - Funded Amount
  - Total Received Amount

📈 Charts & Visualizations

1. **Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line/Area Chart)** – seasonality & lending activity trends  
2. **Regional Analysis by State (Bar Chart)** – loan distribution across states  
3. **Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart)** – loan term distribution  
4. **Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart)** – impact of employment length  
5. **Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart)** – main reasons for borrowing  
6. **Home Ownership Analysis (Tree/Heat Map)** – how ownership impacts loans
